  OpenStack bare metal provisioning a.k.a Ironic is an integrated OpenStack
  program which aims to provision bare metal machines instead of virtual
  machines, forked from the Nova baremetal driver. It is best thought of
  as a bare metal hypervisor API and a set of plugins which interact with
  the bare metal hypervisors. By default, it will use PXE and IPMI in order
  to provision and turn on/off machines, but Ironic also supports
  vendor-specific plugins which may implement additional functionality.
